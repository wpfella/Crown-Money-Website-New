      question: "What is Crown Money?",
      answer: "Crown money is one of Australia’s leading financial coaching services where we have been helping clients pay off their houses in up to half the time, by helping them manage their money more effectively so that it works harder for them. When most people get a standard home loan, at the end of their 30 year loan term they end up paying back close to double the original loan amount to the bank, including all the interest payments. What we do at Crown Money is we help clients restructure their finances in a way that allows them to cut anywhere from 40 to 50% off the total amount that they will end up paying for their home, which allows them to be debt free up to twice as fast. We have a wide range of financial coaching services to help cater for Australians and their financial needs. For the past 20 years we have specialised in helping clients pay off their house much faster than what they’re currently tracking for. We have financial coaching programmes for people who don’t have a mortgage and need help with their money management."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost?",
      answer: "The cost of the services will vary greatly based on many factors, including your current situation and your goals. We have solutions that are free and go all the way up to custom pricing from there. Just like an accountant would need to understand your situation more before they can tell you how much it would be to help you achieve your accounting and tax goals, we are the same from a debt reduction and wealth creation point of view.\n\nSpeak to one of our experts and they will walk you through what your options are. Regardless of what you pick, we always leave clients better than we found them, even if they decide to do it themselves. If you do decide that one of our custom solutions is a good fit, for most clients, they are designed to pay for themselves very quickly through the savings and gains they provide."
    },
    {
      question: "I have an offset account, so I'm already saving interest, how is this different?",
      answer: "The easiest way to describe the difference between an offset account and what we do as financial coaches is think of an offset account as a gym membership. What we do is different, because we’re a gym membership with a personal trainer built in. We all know that people with personal trainers get better results than those who just try and attempt to go to the gym themselves. Offset accounts are there to traditionally help ‘offset’ interest. However, they don’t accelerate the reduction in principal to be paid out in under 15 years due to the way the offset loans are structured. We deliberately structure our money management system so that it reduces principal rapidly and offsets interest at the same time. Getting a 2 prong attack of debt reduction and interest offset working in your favour. The other key difference we have seen with an offset account is they usually only save clients four or five years off a 30-year loan, compared to the vast majority of our clients using our Financial Coaching structure are out of debt and own their homes in under 15 years. The clients on the Crown money management system are outperforming what they were doing before they met us when they had an offset account, even though they have the same income and debt level. Most of our clients have come from an offset account and a ‘cheap rate’ with a bank as their offset account wasn’t working as well for them as they’d expected. Those clients are now saving 200% more and paying down their loans in 50% of the time. A big reason for this uplift in their performance is the financial coaching and software that allows us to coach you on your financial numbers such as your savings rate, your debt reduction speed, surplus cashflow position, what day you own your home, and how much equity you’ve created in your property. The guidance we provide clients around increasing your income, with scripts and strategies on how to get pay rises, as well as helping reduce their expenses with initiatives such as crown coins and auditing your fixed expenses are key reasons these clients make and save as much money as possible compared to an offset account."
    },
    {
      question: "I'm disciplined with my money and stick to a budget. Why would I need this?",
      answer: "This money management system is designed to help accelerate your debt reduction as well as your net worth, and just because you’re disciplined and stick to a budget doesn’t mean that you’re outperforming financially. If you don’t know your numbers or measure them you aren’t in control financially. Do you know when you can make your next financial move such as buying your next property? Do you know how much you could afford, and when you can afford to do that? Do you know your savings rate? Your surplus cash flow position? Do you know exactly what day you’re going to pay your house off ? Just because you stick to a budget doesn’t mean that you’re financially secure and in the best position where your money is working the hardest for you and you’re making excellent financial progress. A lot of the time you won’t have a financial plan in place. We come in and help build that financial strategy and tailor it to you and your specific goals and dreams."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you control all my money and pay my bills for me?",
      answer: "No, we don’t control anyone’s money and we don’t pay anyone’s bills for them. We specifically help with the management of all cash flow and optimise it to make sure that your cash flow structure is running as efficiently as possible. We simply make sure that your funds are available for you when your bills and large expenses are due."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you hold my money or is it still sitting with a bank?",
      answer: "We don’t hold any money on behalf of any clients. Your loan is in your name, your bank accounts are in your name and so all your banking is with your bank or new financial institution that you choose to take out your finances with. We do not hold any money on behalf of any clients at any time."
    },
    {
      question: "Why can't I achieve the same thing with my current bank?",
      answer: "Most Australians think they can achieve great financial results as long as they’ve got a cheap rate and an offset account, but having seen over 6,500 Australian’s financial positions (with offset accounts and cheap rates), they’re unfortunately not outperforming the average Australian. Their savings rate is below 7%. Our average client savings rate is above 24%. Their annual debt reduction is close to $12,000pa and our average client’s annual debt reduction is over $29,327+. Your current bank is focused on keeping you in debt for as long as possible, they’re financially incentivised to make sure you’re paying interest for the longest period of time. We have designed loan structures and money management systems to help you reduce interest, cut down your loan term and make sure your money is working as hard as possible for you."
    },
    {
      question: "I hate paperwork, how long does it take to get set up?",
      answer: "We all hate paperwork. This is similar to going on an overseas holiday. You’ve got the check-in, you’ve got the baggage check, and you’ve got customs and then you’ve got boarding of the plane… All of those frustrating hoops you’ve got to jump through to get to your final destination …. an amazing island holiday. It’s very similar to this process as there is paperwork required, being in the financial services industry we need to be compliant with all the rules and regulations. We have to comply with Anti Money Laundering, Know-Your-Client and Best Interest duty, it is an unavoidable part of this process. The time for the Money Management system to be implemented and setup usually takes four weeks to six weeks from our initial meeting."
    },
    {
      question: "How do we access our money if there's an emergency?",
      answer: "Clients usually have a ‘float’ sitting in their spending account or their Visa debit account. This float, is usually $1000+, and is sitting there to cover any emergencies on the weekends. We are also able to help access funds for an emergency usually within a few hours. There are plenty ways to access money if there’s an emergency and we ensure that you’ll never be caught short."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I want out?",
      answer: "There are no lock-in contracts, there are no handcuffs or penalties for leaving. You can come and go as you please. So if you want out, you can leave at any time. There’s no break costs. There’s no exit fees. Pure and simply you can pick and choose when you come and when you go."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the catch? Why isn't everyone doing this?",
      answer: "Well, why weren’t you doing this before today? Probably because you didn’t know about it, it’s not something that your bank or your broker has discussed with you how you need a financial coach. We let our 20+ years of above average results, case studies, testimonials and happy google reviews speak for themselves."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Crown Money licensed?",
      answer: "Yes, Crown Money holds an Australian Credit Licence (ACL). We are operated by Crown Lending Pty Ltd, ACL Number 388 279, ACN 119 504 862. You can view a copy of our licence [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/crown_money/Website/License%20%26%20Legal/Crown%20Lending%20ASIC%20ACL.pdf)."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you get paid?",
      answer: "We get paid like a mortgage broker gets paid if we are able to refinance your home loan. The bank that we refinance your home loan to will pay us an introduction fee as well as an ongoing management fee. We also have a Money Management system establishment cost, which is usually put on top of the loan. It is to set up the financial coaching system which allows us to manage and coach our clients on their finances going forward."
